# 1990 - 2000: A World Without ... The Internet

Computer networks were first developed in the 1960s and 70s, notably at the National Physical Laboratory network in the UK and with ARPANET in the US. However it was in the 1990s when the internet as we know it today first took shape. Advancements in routing protocols, notably the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) proposed in 1989 by Kirk Lougheed at Cisco and Yakov Rekhter at IBM, allowed the increasing numbers of small networks to inter-operate and forward traffic between each other without the need for a central controller. The global internet was born.

At the same time a new 'killer app' took shape in the form of the World Wide Web, developed by Sir Tim Berners-Lee at CERN between 1989 and 1991. 1s and 0s sent over wires transformed into text and pictures, opening up the internet to a huge new audience. More browsers followed including Netscape Navigator (1994) and Microsoft Internet Explorer (1995) and the commercial possibilities were quickly recognised by the likes of Amazon (1994) and eBay (1995). The explosion of content brought about the need for directories and search engines like Yahoo (1994) and Google (1998).

Internet usage skyrocketed and over the decade the number of connected computers increased from 150,000 to over 70 million. Connecting everything required ever more powerful routers with Cisco briefly becoming the world's most valuable company in March 2000. Improved speeds and reliability opened the way for transporting voice as well as text and the late 90s saw the first IP phones appear.

In 1993 only 1% of global communications travelled over the internet but by 2000 it accounted for more than half. In the years since that trend has increased - by 2007 it was 97% - and today the internet has permeated every aspect of our lives. A world without the internet would leave us without almost all our communication, whether text, voice, video or social media. It would impact over a third of our shopping, now done online, and a similar amount of our TV which is increasingly dominated by streaming services like Netflix. In the UK in 2020 96% of us were internet users and an internet connection is almost as ubiquitous - and critical - in our homes as mains electricity.

## World Without Campaign - Museum Blurb

Covid-19 has meant a sharp drop in our visitors and revenue. Despite our best efforts to find new income, our museum and its work are now in jeopardy. We are therefore launching the World Without campaign to keep our work alive. World Without has four core goals:

* TNMOC houses the world’s largest working collection of historic computers. World Without will raise awareness of our work in research and preservation.
* World Without will secure funding for projects and campaigns in the museum, the community and online, bringing our technology heritage to audiences regardless of location.
* World Without will help extend and develop the museum’s vital work in encouraging young people – particularly girls  – to pursue careers in STEM-related fields.
* Publication of an eBook. Co-written by guest writers, this will discuss milestones in the evolution of modern computing, technology and the high-tech sector.
